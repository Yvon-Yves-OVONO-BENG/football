# Business Logic:

We have football teams. Each team has a name, country, money balance and players.
Each player has name and surname.
Teams can sell/buy players.

What we need in our app:
- Make a page (with pagination) displaying all teams and their players.
- Make a page where we can add a new team and its players.
- Make a page where we can sell/buy a player for a certain amount between two teams.
